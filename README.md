blaze-nav
=============

**blaze-nav** - blaze fast navigation plugin for IntelliJ and derivatives (IDEA, PHPStorm, AppCode, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine) inspired by [ace-jump-mode](https://github.com/winterTTr/ace-jump-mode) for Emacs. In comparison with [similar plugin](https://github.com/johnlindquist/AceJump) **blaze-nav** stays more closely to Emacs version and is less visually noisy.

## Software requirements

At the moment blaze-nav is compatible with latest versions of JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA 12 / 13 EAP, PHPStorm 6, AppCode 2.1, etc).

## Installation

Download plugin jar [file](https://github.com/Bohtvaroh/blaze-nav/raw/master/blaze-nav.jar) and save it locally. Next, open IntelliJ plugin settings page, press 'Install plugin from diskâ€¦' button and select the file downloaded. Restart IDE.

## Hotkeys

1. **ctrl-;** - navigate to a word start;
2. **ctrl-alt-;** - navigate to any letter or symbol;
3. **ctrl-'** - navigate to a line.

These can be reassigned in settings - enter 'blaze nav' in filter on keymap preferences page to quickly locate them.

## How it works

### Navigate to word

Having some text opened in editor, issue **ctrl-;** and enter letter or number which starts a word. Matching characters will be highlighted:

Next, enter one of the highlighted letters to move cursor to its position:

This way you can quickly navigate to any words on the screen with at most three times key press. When only single candidate exists, you'll be moved immediately.

### Navigate to symbol

To quickly navigate to any character on the screen, issue **ctrl-alt-;** and enter the symbol you need to navigate to:

Similarly, enter one of the highlighted letters to move cursor to its position:
